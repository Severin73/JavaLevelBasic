## Tasks in Java Start and Java OOP level.

The course will cover Java fundamentals such as Java Core, collections, multithreading, OOP, design patterns,basic algorithms and data structures.

### 1. Variables

[Task #001](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task001/ReadNumbers.java) -> Write a program that reads a 5-digit number from the keyboard and outputs the digits of which it consists. For example : The number 54698 is read

[Task #002](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task002/AreaOfTriangle.java) -> Write a program that will calculate and display the area of a triangle if its sides are known.

[Task #003](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task003/CircumferenceLength.java) -> Write a program that calculates and displays the length of a circle if its radius is read from the keyboard.

### 2. Operators

[Task #004](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task004/TheBiggestFromFour.java) -> Write a program that counts 4 numbers from the keyboard and displays the largest of them on the screen.

[Task #005](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task005/FloorAndEntranceTheApartment.java) -> There is a nine-storey house with 4 entrances. The entrance number starts with one. There are 4 apartments on one floor. Write a program that will receive the apartment number from the keyboard, and will display on the screen on which floor, which entrance this apartment is located. If there is no such apartment in this house, then you need to inform the user about it.

[Task #006](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task006/LeapYear.java) -> Determine the number of days in the year that the user enters. In a leap year - 366 days, whereas in a normal 365. Leap years are all years divided entirely by 4, with the exception of centuries, which are not divided entirely by 400.

[Task #007](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task007/Triangle.java) ->  Given: a, b, c — sides of the assumed triangle. Write a program that will indicate whether such a triangle exists or not.

[Task #008](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task008/CheckDotPositionInCircle.java) -> There is a circle centered at the (x0, y0) and with a radius of R. The user enters the coordinates of the point x and y from the keyboard. Write a program that will determine whether this point lies inside the circle or not.

[Task #009](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task009/DotInsideTheTriangle.java) -> The triangle coordinates of the vertices A(x1,y1), B(x2,y2), C(x3,y3) are given. The user enters the coordinates of the point x and y from the keyboard.  Write a program that will determine whether this point lies inside a triangle or not.

[Task #010](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task010/LuckyTicket.java) -> heck whether a four-digit number is a lucky ticket. A four-digit number is given. Check if it is a "lucky ticket". Note: a lucky ticket is a number in which - with an even number of digits in the number, the sum of the digits of its left half is equal to the sum of the digits of its right half. For example, consider the number 1322. Its left half is 13, and its right half is 22, and it is a lucky ticket (because 1+3 = 2 + 2)

[Task #011](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task011/PalindromeNumber.java) -> A N-digit number is entered from the keyboard. Check if it is a palindrome.

### 3. Cycles

[Task #012](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task012/WallPaper.java) -> Use cycles to draw "wallpaper". Moreover, the number of bands must be entered from the keyboard.

[Task #013](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task013/Factorial.java) -> Calculate using a loop the factorial of the number - n entered from the keyboard (4 < n < 16). The factorial of a number is the product of all numbers from that number to 1. For example 5!=5*4*3*2*1=120

[Task #014](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task014/MultiplicationTable.java) -> Create the multiplication table by N

[Task #015](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task015/Rectangle.java) -> Display a rectangle from \*. Moreover, the height and width of the rectangle are entered from the keyboard. For example, below is a rectangle with a height of H and a width of W.

[Task #016](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task016/PrimeNumbers.java) -> Use loops to display all prime numbers from 1 to N.

### 4. Strings and arrays

[Task #017](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task017/CountOddDigits.java) -> Given an array — write a program to count odd digits in it.

[Task #018](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task018/IntArray.java) -> Write code for the ability to create an array of integers (the size is entered from the keyboard) and the ability to fill in each of its elements manually. Output this array to the screen.

[Task #019](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task019/ArrayRandom.java) -> Create an array of random numbers (15 elements in size). Create a second array twice as large, the first 15 elements should be equal to the elements of the first array, and fill the remaining elements with twice the initial value. For Example, It Was - {1,4,7,2} Became - {1,4,7,2,2,8,14,4}

[Task #020](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task020/CountCharInString.java) -> Enter a line of text from the keyboard — implement a program to be able to count the number of characters — 'b' in this line, with the output of the result on the screen.

[Task #021](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task021/ReversArray.java) ->Write code for mirroring an array flip (7,2,9,4) -> (4,9,2,7). The array can be of any length. (You cannot use an additional array when performing a task)

### 5. Methods

[Task #022](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task022/MaxInArray.java) -> Write a method that returns the maximum number from an array of integers.

[Task #023](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task023/ConcatTypes.java) -> Implement a method whose parameters are an integer, a real number and a string. It returns the concatenation of a string with the sum of a real and an integer.

[Task #024](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task015/Rectangle.java) -> Implement a method that draws a rectangle of asterisks "*" on the screen — its parameters will be integers that describe the length and width of such a rectangle.
