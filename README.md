## Tasks in Java Start and Java OOP level.

The course will cover Java fundamentals such as Java Core, collections, multithreading, OOP, design patterns,basic algorithms and data structures.

[Task #001](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task001/ReadNumbers.java) -> Write a program that reads a 5-digit number from the keyboard and outputs the digits of which it consists. For example : The number 54698 is read

[Task #002](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task002/AreaOfTriangle.java) -> Write a program that will calculate and display the area of a triangle if its sides are known.

[Task #003](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task003/CircumferenceLength.java) -> Write a program that calculates and displays the length of a circle if its radius is read from the keyboard.

[Task #004](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task004/TheBiggestFromFour.java) -> Write a program that counts 4 numbers from the keyboard and displays the largest of them on the screen.

[Task #005](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task005/FloorAndEntranceTheApartment.java) -> There is a nine-storey house with 4 entrances. The entrance number starts with one. There are 4 apartments on one floor. Write a program that will receive the apartment number from the keyboard, and will display on the screen on which floor, which entrance this apartment is located. If there is no such apartment in this house, then you need to inform the user about it.

[Task #006](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task006/LeapYear.java) -> Determine the number of days in the year that the user enters. In a leap year - 366 days, whereas in a normal 365. Leap years are all years divided entirely by 4, with the exception of centuries, which are not divided entirely by 400.

[Task #007](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task007/Triangle.java) ->  Given: a, b, c â€” sides of the assumed triangle. Write a program that will indicate whether such a triangle exists or not.

[Task #008](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task008/CheckDotPositionInCircle.java) -> There is a circle centered at the (x0, y0) and with a radius of R. The user enters the coordinates of the point x and y from the keyboard. Write a program that will determine whether this point lies inside the circle or not.

[Task #009](https://github.com/Severin73/JavaLevelBasic/blob/main/src/com/javalevelbasic/task009/DotInsideTheTriangle.java) -> The triangle coordinates of the vertices A(x1,y1), B(x2,y2), C(x3,y3) are given. The user enters the coordinates of the point x and y from the keyboard.  Write a program that will determine whether this point lies inside a triangle or not.
